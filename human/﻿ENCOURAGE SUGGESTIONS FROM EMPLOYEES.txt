From:		[YOUR NAME]

Subject:	Your suggestions are valuable


I have a request.

As you know, we are always looking for opportunities--they are the blood of our business.  Whether it’s an opportunity to better serve our customers, to make working here easier for you, or to expand into a new market, they are all highly valued.

I am writing because I know that your are often in a better position to perceive these opportunities than I am.  I encourage you, thus, to voice your suggestions.  [STATE HOW SUGGESTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED, ex. I will indeed be delighted to hear them at your convenience.]  {MENTION INCENTIVE, IF ANY, ex. We will be awarding a “Best Suggestion” award on a yearly basis, with this year’s winner receiving a weekend vacation to Lake Havasu.}
