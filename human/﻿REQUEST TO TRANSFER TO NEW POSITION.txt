Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

As you know, I am very happy to work and contribute to [FIRM, ex. XYZ Limited]’s profits under your authority.

Before you decide who will fill the new [POSITION, ex. Sales Manager] position, please allow me to mention a few matters which I am certain will interest you.

[MENTION REASONS IN A MANNER WHICH IS RELEVANT TO THE RECIPIENT, ex.  John, I have worked as your sales person for over four years.  You have a good idea as to my abilities and potential.  I am confident that you have been pleased with my results.  In turn, having had four years of experience in selling our computer software, I have gained a clear idea as to what our customers’ needs are and how we can meet them.  I know how we can increase sales dramatically and I can gear our sales team to do precisely that. As your Sales Manager, I truly believe that we can achieve in excess of $10,000,000 in sales by the year 2000.]

I understand that you are a very busy person.  I will thus be delighted to meet with you at any time you please to discuss how I can be of greater benefit to you and [FIRM, ex. XYZ Limited].

Cordially,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
