Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

We value your work with us as an employee, and we hope we can continue procuring your services on mutually-beneficial terms.  As we discussed on [DATE, ex. June 10, 1998], the company must closely watch its costs.  It is for this reason that I am concerned about the level of long-distance charges made on our company telephone lines.

In the course of business, I do understand that long-distance calls must be made to maintain relations with our customers and suppliers.  However, our long-distance bills for the past [X] months have totaled $[AMOUNT].  Unfortunately, I am unable to reconcile this figure with my expectations.  I ask, therefore, that you keep track of such calls and attempt to keep them to a minimum by eliminated all unnecessary calls.

[FIRST NAME, ex. John], if there exists an extraordinary or exceptional circumstance which warrants such quantity of calls, please notify me.  Otherwise, I am confident that the matter will be immediately resolved.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
