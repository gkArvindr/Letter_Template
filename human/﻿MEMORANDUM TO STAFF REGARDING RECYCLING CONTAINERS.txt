Subject:	RECYCLING CONTAINERS

There are now two recycling bins in our offices. A blue box is located in the kitchen for bottles and cans. A second bin is in the supply room located and can be used to recycle pulp and paper products (ie. scrap paper, notes, memos, etc.).

Please make an effort to use both bins in order to cut down on our waste within the office.

Your anticipated co-operation is greatly appreciated.
