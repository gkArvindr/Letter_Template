Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

We value your work with us as an employee, and we hope we can continue procuring your services on mutually-beneficial terms.  As we discussed on [DATE, ex. June 10, 1998], the company greatly values your time; indeed, we need you in the office as much as possible!  It is for this reason that prolonged lunch breaks blemish the quality of the service you provide.

I do understand that breaks are often needed from your hectic schedule.  Unfortunately, however, you have extended your lunch break from [X] to [Y] minutes on each of [Z] occasions during the past month.  Regrettably, this is unacceptable.  

[FIRST NAME, ex. John], if there exists an extraordinary or exceptional circumstance which prevents you from taking prolonged lunch breaks, please contact me and we will discuss the situation accordingly.  Otherwise, I am confident that you will return to your past history of exceptional performance and that the matter will be immediately resolved.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
