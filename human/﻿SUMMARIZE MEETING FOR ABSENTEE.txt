I’m sorry you were unable to attend our meeting on [DATE, ex. Wednesday].  Here’s a recap of what we discussed and concluded.

[SUMMARIZE MEETING RESULTS, ex. We decided to drop the 431B line as changing consumer preferences have rendered it obsolete.]  [MENTION ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN AND ASSIGNMENTS, ex. Jim will immediately discontinue any marketing efforts for that model; Bill will arrange liquidating the inventory, and I will handle the existing customer orders.]  [MENTION WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THE RECIPIENT AS A RESULT, ex. Accordingly, John, please contact our suppliers and determine whether we can arrange for an aggregate return.  We are willing to take a 20% hit, if possible.]

Contact me if there is something you think we have overlooked.
