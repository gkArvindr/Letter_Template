Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

I am writing this letter following our discussion on [DATE, ex. June 10, 1998].  It is due to your loyal performance that we provide an expense account for your use.  We hope its use has better enabled you to provide the services your position at our firm involves.  Equally, we hope that this privilege has saved you the time and the hassle of reimbursement.

Unfortunately, your expense account balances have exceeded ordinarily reasonable limits in the past [NUMBER OF MONTHS, ex. three] months: $[X] in [MONTH, ex. January], $[Y] in [MONTH, ex. February] and $[Z] in [MONTH, ex. May].  The reason I am alarmed is that employees in similar positions in our firm roughly incur only $[AVERAGE AMOUNT] in expenses per month.

If an extraordinary circumstance or situation is the cause of my concern, please notify me immediately and we will attempt to remedy the situation.  Otherwise, I am confident that you will redress this matter in the quick and exceptional nature which is characteristic of your historical performance at our firm.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
