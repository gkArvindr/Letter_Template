Date:		[DATE OF MEMORANDUM]

Subject:	[DESCRIBE SUBJECT OF POOR PERFORMANCE, ex. Report on Pricing Policy of Competitor]


I have just reviewed the report you prepared on the above subject and I must let you know that I am disappointed.

[DESCRIBE REASONS FOR DISAPPOINTMENT, ex. Despite all the necessary resources at your disposal and considerable time to deal with this matter, I found your analysis to be superficial and lacking focus.]

Regretfully, the report cannot be relied upon to assist us with our planning for the upcoming year. Please review it and provide me with a redraft by [DATE REVISED REPORT REQUIRED].

If there are any circumstances which you wish to draw to my attention regarding the quality of the report, I would be prepared to discuss them directly with you.

However, I would ask that you make a much more determined effort to achieve better quality results in the future.
