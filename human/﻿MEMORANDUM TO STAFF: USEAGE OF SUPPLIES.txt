MEMORANDUM TO STAFF: USEAGE OF SUPPLIES


M E M O R A N D U M

To:		ALL STAFF

From:		[NAME OF SENDER]

Date:		[DATE OF MEMORANDUM]

Subject:	RECYCLING CONTAINERS


I have recently noticed that the supplies in the supply room are being consumed at an accelerated rate, which is not in proportion to our level of business activity. I have also observed a trend toward hoarding supplies at individual's work stations.

These trends must be reversed. I would ask all staff to review their supplies at their work stations and return any excess or duplicate supplies back to the supply room. This will ensure an adequate inventory of supplies for all staff, and will reduce our costs.

Your anticipated co-operation is greatly appreciated.
