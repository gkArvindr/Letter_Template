STAFF VACATION POLICY

Vacation Policy

Each full time staff member is entitled to five (5) days of paid Vacation Entitlement for each Period of employment with the company.

Vacations are tracked on a calendar year basis.

Vacation Entitlement must be taken within twelve (12) months of the year end in which it was earned failing which it will lapse. All vacation requests must be pre-approved by management. While every effort will be made to accommodate the duration and timing of a vacation request by a staff member, such request will be subject to workload and seniority among staff.
