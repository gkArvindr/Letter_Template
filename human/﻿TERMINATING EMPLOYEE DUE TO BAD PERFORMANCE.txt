Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

I regret that [STATE GOAL NOT MET, ex. the cost overruns at your division have reached unacceptable levels].  As I mentioned in my memorandums of [DATE, ex. April 5] and [DATE, ex.

I am forced, therefore, to terminate your employment as of [DATE, ex. July 30, 1998].  [STATE ADDITIONAL TERMS OF TERMINATION, ex. Your company medical insurance plan will also be terminated at that time.]  I regret that matters could not have been redressed in a more amicable manner.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
