Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

[STATE CONTEXT AND NATURE OF BAD PERFORMANCE, CITING ALL WARNINGS GIVEN, ex. As you know, customer relations is key to the survival of our business.  It thus alarms me when I receive several complaints from key customers which involve impoliteness and rudeness on your part.  You will recall my letter of June 1 and our meeting last week in which I informed you that this type of behavior is unacceptable and urged you to changed your behavior.  Unfortunately, however, I have continued to receive such complaints.]

I am forced, therefore, to terminate your employment as of [DATE, ex. July 30, 1998].  [STATE ADDITIONAL TERMS OF TERMINATION, ex. Your company medical insurance plan will also be terminated at that time.]  I regret that matters could not have been redressed in a more amicable manner.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
