Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

We value your work with us as an employee, and we hope we can continue procuring your services on mutually-beneficial terms.  As we discussed on [DATE, ex. June 10, 1998], the company greatly values your time.  Excessive use of the company phone for personal calls not only robs us of your valued time, but also ties our lines and may prevent important business calls from coming through.

I do understand that, on occasion, every employee has important personal matters to which he or she must attend while on the job.  Unfortunately, however, your excessive use is unacceptable.

[FIRST NAME, ex. John], if there exists an extraordinary or exceptional circumstance, please contact me and we will discuss the situation accordingly.  Otherwise, I am confident that you will return to your past history of exceptional performance and that the matter will be immediately resolved.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
