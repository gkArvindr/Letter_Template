Subject:	Meeting Attendance


[RECIPIENT NAME, ex. John], you know that I value your suggestions and insights; indeed, you are a great asset when a major decision must be made.  It is for this reason I am disappointed that you have missed several key meetings ([LIST MEETINGS MISSED, ex. Quarterly sales staff meeting, June 15, Executive meeting, June 20, and our meeting with Mr. Johnson on July 1]).  Unfortunately, missing these meetings blemish your history of good performance.

I need you at these meetings, [RECIPIENT NAME, ex. John].  As you know, I like to have all my top employees’ input before a decision is made.  Accordingly, please make certain that you are able to attend in the future.
