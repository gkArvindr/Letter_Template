Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

As you know, we contracted your services to manage our public relations and ultimately to maintain our firm’s image in favorable public light.  [STATE SPECIFIC MATTER WITH WHICH YOU ARE DISPLEASED, ex. We are particularly displeased with the manner in which the gun rally activists incident was handled.]  Accordingly, we are questioning whether continuing to do business together is mutually beneficial.

We would like to give you an opportunity to discuss the matter with us and bring to light any points you deem relevant.  I am confident that we can come to a reasonable conclusion together.  Please call me at XXX-XXXX.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
