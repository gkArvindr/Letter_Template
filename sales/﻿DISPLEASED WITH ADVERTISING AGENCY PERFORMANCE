Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

As you know, we contracted your services to increase our sales by a reasonable and sufficient amount.  Unfortunately, a review of our financial performance since retaining your services indicates that sales have not increased as expected.  Accordingly, we are questioning whether continuing to do business with your firm is profitable for us.

We would like to give you an opportunity to discuss the matter with us and bring to light any points you deem relevant.  I am confident that we can come to a reasonable conclusion together.  Please call me at XXX-XXXX.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
