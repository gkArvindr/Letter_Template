Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

Unfortunately, we have decided to terminate retaining your advertising services.  [STATE REASON(S), ex. An analysis of our financial performance in the past year has indicated that the benefits of your services do not justify the fees charged.]  Accordingly, we are no longer able to continue our relationship.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
