DECLINE REQUEST TO BE INTERVIEWED BY PRESS

Anycity, Anystate  85245]

Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

I consider your invitation to interview me for [PUBLICATION, ex. The Hamilton Globe] to be an honor.  I believe [INTERVIEW SUBJECT, ex. the issue of industrial development in the Hamilton area] to be a genuine and important topic.

It is for this reason that I am disappointed I must decline your invitation.  [STATE REASON(S), ex. Since I do not consider myself to be an expert on the matter, you can understand my hesitation to form and assert an opinion on it.  May I suggest Mr. John Wright?  I believe his involvement in the city planning department would be far more useful than my background.]

Thank you again for this honor.

Sincerely,
 

[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
