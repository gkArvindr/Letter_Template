Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

Unfortunately, we have decided to terminate retaining your services.  [STATE REASON(S), We believe the press releases and radio interviews regarding the marketing of our products in third world countries was mishandled; the ensuing bad press we received was quite damaging to our firm’s brand equity and may be irreparable.]  Accordingly, we deem it beneficial to terminate our relationship.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
