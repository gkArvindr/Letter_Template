Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

As a result of a clerical error on your part, our check issued to [NAME OF CHECK PAYEE, ex. ABC Corp.] bearing no. [CHECK NO., ex. 9999] and dated [DATE OF CHECK, ex. June 1, 1998] in the amount of [AMOUNT OF CHECK, ex. $10,000] was not honored.

This caused us embarrassment with our key supplier. Would you therefore provide us with a letter confirming the bank's error, so that we can provide a copy to our supplier and ensure that they do not loose confidence in our financial viability.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.


Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
