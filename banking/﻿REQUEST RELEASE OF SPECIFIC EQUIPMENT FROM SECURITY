Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

According to the terms of our credit arrangement with you, we provided you with general security over all of our property, assets and undertaking.

[EXPLAIN REASONS WHY RELEASE IS BEING REQUESTED] ex. As you may be aware, we currently own a large piece of equipment which has become redundant. We wish to replace this with a newer model, however the supplier requires a release of your security before accepting the old equipment]

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.


Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
