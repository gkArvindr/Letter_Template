Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

We refer to the License Agreement between [NAME OF FIRST PARTY TO AGREEMENT] and [NAME OF SECOND PARTY TO AGREEMENT] dated [DATE OF AGREEMENT, ex. January 5, 1996].

With regret, the Agreement has not achieved the results which we had anticipated and as a result, we must ask that the Agreement be terminated prior to its original termination date.

In this regard, we have taken the liberty of enclosing two copies of a form of mutual release to be signed and exchanged between us. We have already signed both copies and would ask that you kindly sign both copies and return one fully signed copy to us.

We thank you for your anticipated co-operation.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
