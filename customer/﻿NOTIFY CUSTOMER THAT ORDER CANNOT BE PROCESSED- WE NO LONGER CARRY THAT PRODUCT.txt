Dear [NAME, ex. John Smith],

I would like to thank you for your order of [PRODUCT(S), ex. 4 Magnaflux compressors].  

Unfortunately, however, we no longer carry the [PRODUCT, ex. Magnaflux compressor] because we believe it does not provide our customers sufficient value for its price.  We base this decision on [REASON(S), ex. customer complaints and its history of breakdown.]

Instead, we carry [PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE, INCLUDING ITS FEATURES AND PRICE ex. the new FluxMetric compressor, which features double the capacity of the Magnaflux.  At $1,260, the FluxMetric is well worth the extra $60 in price as it is designed to last longer without the regular and costly maintenance bills associated with the Magnaflux.]  {I have taken the liberty of enclosing [ENCLOSURES, ex. a brochure of the new FluxMetric compressor, including schematics and customer testimonials].}

Allow me to apologize for any inconveniences this may have caused you.  I am ready, however, to upgrade your order immediately to the [ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT, ex. FluxMetric] at your request.  You may reach me at XXX-XXXX.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Jill Jones]
