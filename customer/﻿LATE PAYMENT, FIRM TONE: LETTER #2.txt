Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

I am writing this letter to inform you that we have still not received your payment of $[AMOUNT], which was due on [DATE, ex. May 5, 1998].  Unfortunately, we are forced to impose a [X]% fee for late payment as per our credit policies.

To avoid additional charges, we encourage you to forward payment as soon as possible.  If this is not possible, please contact me so that we may discuss an alternative payment plan.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
