Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

It has been a pleasure to serve you in the past, and we look forward to doing business with you in the future.

As you may know, [STATE REASON FOR PRICE INCREASE, ex. the dollar has fallen substantially against the yen and economists do not expect it to rise significantly in the near future.  Since our Magnaflux compressor uses several parts which are imported from Asia, we have suffered a significant increase in our costs.]

Our first aim is to please our customers.  Indeed, however, we will not be able to serve you if our business incurs losses.  Unfortunately, we are left with no rational alternative but to increase our prices.  We are confident, nonetheless, that you will find the quality of our [products/services] even in light of these new prices to be quite reasonable and competitive.

Enclosed, please find a copy of our new price list, which is effective [DATE, ex. immediately].

While we are not happy about this announcement, we are confident you will continue to be pleased with our superior [products/services].  We look forward to continued business together.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
