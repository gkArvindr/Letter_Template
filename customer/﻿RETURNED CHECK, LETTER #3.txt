Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

Reluctantly, I am writing to you regarding an unfortunate situation--after two unsuccessful attempts to deposit your checks, we have not heard from you.  Since I understand that your good credit rating is important to you, I am hesitant to take any actions which may blemish it.  However, I will be left with no choice but to forward your account to a credit agency or commence legal actions if I do not hear from you within the next three business days.  I am sure that this matter can be easily redressed in a mutually-agreeable manner if you get in touch with me at XXX-XXXX.

I am looking forward to talking to you so that we may avoid further embarrassments and frustrations.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
