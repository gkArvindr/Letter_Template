Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

I was sorry to hear that you wish to return our [STATE PRODUCT, ex. Magnaflux compressor]. I want you to know that your satisfaction is extremely important to me.  For this reason, I will promptly accept your return and [STATE HOW REFUND/CREDIT WILL BE PROCESSED, ex. send you a check in the amount of $3,200.00 upon receipt of your compressor.  As I mentioned to you, however, we must charge a 15% restocking fee.]

{TOUT A REPLACEMENT PRODUCT, IF POSSIBLE, ex.  I understand that operating temperature is a key concern for you.  May I take this opportunity, Mr. Smith, to suggest our R3B model?

Please call me at XXX-XXXX if I can serve you in any way.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
