Dear [NAME, ex. John Smith],

By mistake, we shipped your order (#[ORDER NUMBER]) [SHIPMENT TYPE, ex. Overnight] instead of [SHIPMENT TYPE, ex. Express] because we thought time was of key consideration.  Since this is our mistake, [we have credited the difference to your account / we have enclosed a check in the amount of the difference].

Please do not hesitate to call me at XXX-XXXX if there is something I can do for you.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Jill Jones]
