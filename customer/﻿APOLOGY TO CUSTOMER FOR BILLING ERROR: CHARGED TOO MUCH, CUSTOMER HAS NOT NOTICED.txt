Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

Since we value your business greatly, I have been inspecting our invoices to ensure that we have made no errors.  Unfortunately, however, I have uncovered an error on invoice #[STATE INVOICE NUMBER].  Please accept my apologies for over-billing you by $[AMOUNT].

I will immediately nullify that invoice ( [STATE INVOICE NUMBER, ex. #A423F] ) and issue you a correct one, as follows:

[LIST NEW INVOICE DETAILS, ex.
	5 Magnaflux compressors @ $4,000 		$20,000
	Tax @ 5%					   1,000
	Total						$21,000]

Let me assure you that I will personally inspect our invoices to you in the future to ensure that there will be no further errors.  Feel free to contact me at XXX-XXXX if there are any other issues you wish me to address.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
