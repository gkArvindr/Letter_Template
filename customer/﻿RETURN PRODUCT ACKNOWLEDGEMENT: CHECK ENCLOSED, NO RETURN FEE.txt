Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

If you are not satisfied, we have not done our job properly.  I’m sorry that you are not pleased with [STATE PRODUCT(S) our Magnaflux compressor] (invoice #[INVOICE NUMBER]) and I will immediately process your return.

Ordinarily, we issue a credit to be used against your next invoice and, levy a [X]% [restocking / return etc.] fee to cover the costs we incur to restock and repackage the product.  Since your satisfaction is our business, I have waived the restocking fee and enclosed a check for the full amount of your return.

{ADDRESS THE REASON FOR THE RETURN AND TOUT ANOTHER PRODUCT, IF APPLICABLE, ex. I understand that operating temperature is a key concern for you.  May I take this opportunity, Mr. Smith, to suggest our R3B model?  This model will interface with your existing machinery and operate at a far lower temperature.  I will be pleased to discuss the R3B’s features with you at your request.}

Please call me at XXX-XXXX if I can serve you in any way.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
