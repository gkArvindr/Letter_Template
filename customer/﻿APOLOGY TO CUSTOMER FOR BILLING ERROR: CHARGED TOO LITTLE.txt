Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

Since we value your business greatly, I have been inspecting our invoices to ensure that we have made no errors.

You can understand, then, my embarrassment when I uncovered an error on our invoice #[ INVOICE NUMBER]. [STATE ERROR, ex. Although we shipped to you five Magnaflux compressors, per your order, we incorrectly billed you for four compressors.]  Please check your records and notify me if I am mistaken.

I will nullify that invoice ( #[INVOICE NUMBER, ex. #A423F] ) and issue you a new one as follows:

[LIST NEW INVOICE DETAILS, ex.
	5 Magnaflux compressors @ $4,000 		$20,000
	Tax @ 5%					   1,000
	Total						$21,000]

Let me assure you that I will personally inspect our invoices to you in the future to ensure that there will be no further errors.  Feel free to contact me at XXX-XXXX if there are any issues you wish me to address.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
