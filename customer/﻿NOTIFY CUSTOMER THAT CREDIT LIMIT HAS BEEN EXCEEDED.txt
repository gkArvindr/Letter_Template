I urge to you check your records to determine whether our records are incorrect.

If you determine that our records are correct, I request that you forward to us payment in the amount of $[DIFFERENCE], to bring your account up to date.  I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
