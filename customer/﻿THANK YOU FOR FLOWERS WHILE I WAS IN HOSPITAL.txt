Dear [NAME, ex. John Smith],

I was pleasantly surprised to receive the flowers you sent me [DATE, ex. last week] at [HOSPITAL, ex. North York General Hospital].  Indeed, they were beautiful and indicative of your kindness. [MENTION RECOVERY, ex. I feel much better now that the pain is gone; the doctor says I will fully recover in two to three weeks.]

I truly appreciate your consideration.

Best regards,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Jill Jones]
