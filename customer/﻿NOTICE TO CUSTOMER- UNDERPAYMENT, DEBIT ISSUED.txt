We have just received your payment of $[AMOUNT, ex. 5,200.24] for [PRODUCT(S) / SERVICE(S), ex. your order of five Magnaflux compressors].  Thank you for your payment.  Our records, however, indicate that the total billing for that invoice (#[INVOICE NUMBER]) is $[AMOUNT, ex. 5,400.24].  Please check your records to ensure that I have not made a mistake.

Unless I hear from you, there is no need to send us a check for the remainder; we will debit your account by $[AMOUNT, ex, 200.00], to be added to your next invoice.

Please call me at XXX-XXXX if I can be of any assistance.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Jill Jones]
