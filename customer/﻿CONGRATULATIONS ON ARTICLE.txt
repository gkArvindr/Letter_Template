Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

I very much enjoyed reading your article, [TITLE, ex. “The Application of Statistical Techniques in Manufacturing Management”], in [PUBLICATIONS, ex. Management Weekly].  [MENTION A POINT ON WHICH YOU AGREE WITH AUTHOR, ex. I indeed agree with you that X-bar charting techniques are key in determining when a manufacturing process is malfunctioning.]

Allow me this opportunity to congratulate you on this publication. It is an honor to know a person whose work has been recognized this respectable [magazine / newspaper / publication, etc.].

Best regards,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
