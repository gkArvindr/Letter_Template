Dear [NAME, ex. John Smith],

You have indeed embarrassed me by your present.  [COMPLIMENT PRESENT, ex. The painting is nothing short of beautiful].  That is why I truly regret that I cannot accept it.

I have a policy of not accepting expensive gifts from [GROUP, ex. our customers].  Although I would love to keep it, your gracious gift falls under this category.  Nonetheless, I sincerely thank you for the thought.

Best regards,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Jill Jones]
