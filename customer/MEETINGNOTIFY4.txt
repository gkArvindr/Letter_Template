Dear [NAME, ex. John Smith],

You must have forgotten our [DATE & TIME, ex. Wednesday, 2-30 PM] meeting.  Although I understand how busy your schedule is, you have missed [NUMBER, ex. a total of three] meetings.  Surely you can see that this is disagreeable and upsetting to me.  Although I have tried to work around your schedules in the past, I am afraid I can no longer afford the risk of another unannounced cancellation.  Regrettably, I will no longer be able to see you in the event of another missed appointment.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Jill Jones]
