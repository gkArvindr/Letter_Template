Dear [NAME, ex. Arvind GK],

Unfortunately, we have not received payment or heard from you regarding your unpaid account balance of $[AMOUNT].  As three months have past since the due date, we are forced to take actions to repossess the products we sold to you on [DATE, ex. March 11, 1998], namely: [PRODUCT LIST, ex. one ElectroMag television and one Aqualite television stand].

If we do not receive payment or hear from you within the next five business days, we will contact you to arrange an appointment for repossession of the above item{s}.  We urge you to take every effort to avoid these proceedings as they will undoubtedly be mutually-disagreeable.

Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME, ex. Arvind GK]
